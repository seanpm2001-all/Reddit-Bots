# README - u/gogitops contribution

Context: I have a repository named [Go!-ogle](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Go-ogle/) which is written in Go! but not Go. There is a difference between the 2 languages, but Googles Go is far more popular than the early 2000s language Go!

Backstory: when I created my first Reddit subreddit, I received a notification regarding my only repository written in Go! The bot [u/gogitops](https://www.reddit.com/user/gogitops) mistook my Go!-ogle repository as a repository written in Go, when it is actually written in Go!

I responded several days later, I may have put too much emphasis on the difference part, and I surprisingly received a response, and that the bot creator would factor in the Go! language.

If the creator of the gogitops bot is reading this, I want you to know I was not angry. I also thank you for listening to community feedback and working on making the improvement. Thank you for your work in the field of computing!
